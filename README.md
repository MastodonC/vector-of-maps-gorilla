# vector-of-maps gorilla
just want to be able to display my vector of maps in a nice tabular format.
Based on core-matrix-gorilla (developed by Kiran Karkera)

## Usage

Add
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/vector-of-maps-gorilla.svg)](https://clojars.org/vector-of-maps-gorilla)
 to your project's dependencies. You will also need to have the lein-gorilla plugin in your project's plugin vector (see
Gorilla REPL's [getting started](http://gorilla-repl.org/start.html) page for help with installing Gorilla).
You can then `(use 'vector-of-maps-gorilla.render)` in your Gorilla worksheets.
